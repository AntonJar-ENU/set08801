		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<h2>Background</h2>
		
		<p>Resistance from native Caribs prevented colonization on Saint Vincent until 1719. 
		France and England disputed the island for most of the 18th century, 
		but it was ceded to England in 1783. 
		Between 1960 and 1962, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was a separate administrative unit 
		of the Federation of the West Indies. Autonomy was granted in 1969 and independence in 1979.</p>
